  <p>You say you want a revolution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    We all want to change the world<br />
    You tell me that it's evolution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    We all want to change the world<br />
    But when you talk about destruction<br />
    Don't you know you can count me out </p>
  <p> Don't you know it's gonna be alright<br />
    Alright, alright </p>
  <p> You say you got a real solution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    We don't love to see the plan<br />
    You ask me for a contribution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    We're doing what we can<br />
    But if you want money for people with minds that hate<br />
    All I can tell you is brother you have to wait </p>
  <p> Don't you know it's gonna be alright<br />
    Alright, alright, al... </p>
  <p> You say you'll change the constitution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    We all want to change your head<br />
    You tell me it's the institution<br />
    Well you know<br />
    You better free your mind instead<br />
    But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao<br />
    You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow </p>
  <p> Don't you know know it's gonna be alright<br />
    Alright, alright </p>
  <p> Alright, alright<br />
    Alright, alright<br />
    Alright, alright<br />
    Alright, alright</p>
