  <p>Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br />
    Take a sad song and make it better.<br />
    Remember to let her into your heart,<br />
    Then you can start to make it better.</p>
  <p> Hey Jude, don't be afraid.<br />
    You were made to go out and get her.<br />
    The minute you let her under your skin,<br />
    Then you begin to make it better.</p>
  <p> And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br />
    Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.<br />
    For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br />
    By making his world a little colder.</p>
  <p> Hey Jude, don't let me down.<br />
    You have found her, now go and get her.<br />
    Remember to let her into your heart,<br />
    Then you can start to make it better.</p>
  <p> So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,<br />
    You're waiting for someone to perform with.<br />
    And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,<br />
    The movement you need is on your shoulder.</p>
  <p> Hey Jude, don't make it bad.<br />
    Take a sad song and make it better.<br />
    Remember to let her under your skin,<br />
    Then you'll begin to make it<br />
    Better better better better better better, oh.</p>
  <p> Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude...</p>
