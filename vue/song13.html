  <p>This happened once before<br />
    When I came to your door<br />
    No reply<br />
    They said it wasn't you<br />
    But I saw you peep through your window</p>
  <p> I saw the lie, I saw the lie<br />
    I know that you saw me<br />
    As I looked up to your face</p>
  <p> I tried to telephone<br />
    They said you were not home<br />
    That's a lie<br />
    Cos I know where you've been<br />
    I saw you walk in your door</p>
  <p> I nearly died, I nearly died<br />
    Cos you walked hand in hand<br />
    With another man in my place</p>
  <p> If I were you'd realise that I<br />
    Love you more than any other guy<br />
    And I'll forgive the lies that I<br />
    Heard before when you gave me no reply</p>
  <p> I've tried to telephone<br />
    They said you were not home<br />
    That's a lie<br />
    Cos I know where you've been<br />
    I saw you walk in your door</p>
  <p> I nearly died, I nearly died<br />
    Cos you walked hand in hand<br />
    With another man in my place</p>
  <p> No reply, no reply</p>
