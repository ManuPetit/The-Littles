  <p>She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah </p>
  <p> You think you lost your love,<br />
    When I saw her yesterday.<br />
    It's you she's thinking of<br />
    And she told me what to say.<br />
    She says she loves you<br />
    And you know that can't be bad.<br />
    Yes, she loves you<br />
    And you know you should be glad. Ooh! </p>
  <p> She said you hurt her so<br />
    She almost lost her mind.<br />
    She said to let you know<br />
    You're not the hurting kind.<br />
    She says she loves you<br />
    And you know that can't be bad.<br />
    Yes, she loves you<br />
    And you know you should be glad. Ooh! </p>
  <p> She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    And with a love like that<br />
    You know you should be glad. </p>
  <p> And now it's up to you,<br />
    I think it's only fair,<br />
    Pride can hurt you, too,<br />
    Apologize to her<br />
    Because she loves you<br />
    And you know that can't be bad.<br />
    Yes, she loves you<br />
    And you know you should be glad. Ooh! </p>
  <p> She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
    And with a love like that<br />
    You know you should be glad.<br />
    With a love like that<br />
    You know you should be glad.<br />
    With a love like that,<br />
    You know you sho-o-ould<br />
    Be Glad!<br />
    Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />
    Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.</p>
