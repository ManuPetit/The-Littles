  <p>In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs<br />
    Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.<br />
    And all the people that come and go<br />
    Stop and say hello. </p>
  <p> On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,<br />
    The little children laugh at him behind his back.<br />
    And the banker never wears a mack<br />
    In the pouring rain, very strange. </p>
  <p> Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br />
    There beneath the blue suburban skies<br />
    I sit, and meanwhile back </p>
  <p> In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass<br />
    And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.<br />
    He likes to keep his fire engine clean,<br />
    It's a clean machine. </p>
  <p> Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br />
    A four of fish and finger pies<br />
    In summer, meanwhile back </p>
  <p> Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout<br />
    The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray<br />
    And tho' she feels as if she's in a play<br />
    She is anyway. </p>
  <p> In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,<br />
    We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.<br />
    And then the fireman rushes in<br />
    From the pouring rain, very strange. </p>
  <p> Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br />
    There beneath the blue suburban skies<br />
    I sit, and meanwhile back.<br />
    Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br />
    There beneath the blue suburban skies,<br />
    Penny Lane.</p>
