  <p> A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood<br />
    He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good<br />
    He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write<br />
    Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night<br />
    Well, he put some tacks on teachers chair<br />
    Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair<br />
    Hey, junior, behave yourself</p>
  <p> Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand<br />
    Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man<br />
    Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop<br />
    From rocking and a-rolling spinning in a hula hoop<br />
    Well this rock and roll has got to stop<br />
    Junior's head is hard as rock<br />
    Now, junior, behave yourself</p>
  <p> Going tell your mama you better do what she said<br />
    Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head<br />
    Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat<br />
    You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat<br />
    Well, mama's head has got to stop<br />
    Junior's head is hard as rock<br />
    Now, junior, behave yourself </p>
