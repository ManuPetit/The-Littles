  <p>Try to see it my way,<br />
    Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?<br />
    While you see it your way,<br />
    Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone. </p>
  <p> We can work it out,<br />
    We can work it out. </p>
  <p> Think of what you're saying.<br />
    You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.<br />
    Think of what I'm saying,<br />
    We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night. </p>
  <p> We can work it out,<br />
    We can work it out. </p>
  <p> Life is very short, and there's no time<br />
    For fussing and fighting, my friend.<br />
    I have always thought that it's a crime,<br />
    So I will ask you once again. </p>
  <p> Try to see it my way,<br />
    Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.<br />
    While you see it your way<br />
    There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long. </p>
