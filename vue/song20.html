  <p>Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music<br />
    Any old way you choose it<br />
    It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's gotta be rock and roll music<br />
    If you wanna dance with me<br />
    If you wanna dance with me </p>
  <p> I've got no kick against modern jazz<br />
    Unless they try to play it too darn fast<br />
    And lose the beauty of the melody<br />
    Until they sound just like a symphony </p>
  <p> That's why I go for that that rock and roll music<br />
    Any old way you choose it<br />
    It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's gotta be rock and roll music<br />
    If you wanna dance with me<br />
    If you wanna dance with me </p>
  <p> I took my loved one over across the tracks<br />
    So she can hear my man awail a sax<br />
    I must admit they have a rocking band<br />
    Man, they were blowing like a hurricane </p>
  <p> That's why I go for that that rock and roll music<br />
    Any old way you choose it<br />
    It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's gotta be rock and roll music<br />
    If you wanna dance with me<br />
    If you wanna dance with me </p>
  <p> Way down South they had a jubilee<br />
    The jokey folks they had a jamboree<br />
    They're drinking home brew from a water cup<br />
    The folks dancing there are all shook up </p>
  <p> And started playing that that rock and roll music<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's gotta be rock and roll music<br />
    If you wanna dance with me<br />
    If you wanna dance with me </p>
  <p> Don't care to hear them play a tango<br />
    And In The Mood they take a mambo<br />
    It's way to early for a congo<br />
    So keep a rocking that piano </p>
  <p> That's why I go for that that rock and roll music<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    It's got a back beat, you can't lose it<br />
    Any old time you use it<br />
    Gotta be rock and roll music<br />
    If you wanna dance with me<br />
    If you wanna dance with me</p>
