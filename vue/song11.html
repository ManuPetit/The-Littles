  <p>Well, she was just 17<br />
    You know what I mean<br />
    And the way she looked was way beyond compare<br />
    So how could I dance with another (Ooh)<br />
    When I saw her standing there</p>
  <p> Well she looked at me, and I, I could see<br />
    That before too long I'd fall in love with her<br />
    She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)<br />
    When I saw her standing there</p>
  <p> Well, my heart went "boom"<br />
    When I crossed that room<br />
    And I held her hand in mine...</p>
  <p> Whoah, we danced through the night<br />
    And we held each other tight<br />
    And before too long I fell in love with her<br />
    Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)<br />
    Since I saw her standing there</p>
