  <p>Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away<br />
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay<br />
    Oh, I believe in yesterday. </p>
  <p> Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,<br />
    There's a shadow hanging over me.<br />
    Oh, yesterday came suddenly. </p>
  <p> Why she had to go I don't know she woldn't say.<br />
    I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday. </p>
  <p> Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.<br />
    Now I need a place to hide away.<br />
    Oh, I believe in yesterday. </p>
  <p> Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm.</p>
