    Can't buy me love</p>
  <p> I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright<br />
    I'll get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright<br />
    'Cause I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love</p>
  <p> I'll give you all I got to give if you say you love me too<br />
    I may not have a lot to give but what I got I'll give to you<br />
    I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love</p>
  <p> Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so<br />
    Can't buy me love, no no no, no</p>
  <p> Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied<br />
    Tell me that you want the kind of thing that money just can't buy<br />
    I don't care too much for money, money can't buy me love </p>
