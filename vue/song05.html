  <p>Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner<br />
    But he knew it wouldn't last.<br />
    Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona<br />
    For some California grass.</p>
  <p> Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged<br />
    Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged.<br />
    Get back Jojo. Go home</p>
  <p> Get back, get back.<br />
    Back to where you once belonged<br />
    Get back, get back.<br />
    Back to where you once belonged.<br />
    Get back Jo.</p>
  <p> Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman<br />
    But she was another man<br />
    All the girls around her say she's got it coming<br />
    But she gets it while she can</p>
  <p> Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged<br />
    Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged.<br />
    Get back Loretta. Go home</p>
  <p> Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged<br />
    Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged.<br />
    Get back Loretta</p>
  <p> Your mother's waiting for you<br />
    Wearing her high-heel shoes<br />
    And her low-neck sweater<br />
    Get on home Loretta<br />
    Get back, get back.<br />
    Get back to where you once belonged. </p>
