  <p>Help, I need somebody,<br />
    Help, not just anybody,<br />
    Help, you know I need someone, help.</p>
  <p> When I was younger, so much younger than today,<br />
    I never needed anybody's help in any way.<br />
    But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,<br />
    Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.</p>
  <p> Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br />
    And I do appreciate you being round.<br />
    Help me, get my feet back on the ground,<br />
    Won't you please, please help me.</p>
  <p> And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,<br />
    My independence seems to vanish in the haze.<br />
    But every now and then I feel so insecure,<br />
    I know that I just need you like I've never done before.</p>
  <p> Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br />
    And I do appreciate you being round.<br />
    Help me, get my feet back on the ground,<br />
    Won't you please, please help me.</p>
